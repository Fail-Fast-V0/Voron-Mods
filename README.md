This allows you to convert your V0.1 Mini Afterburner to a Bowden system with a single printed part. The only additional hardware you need is an embedded collet as used in the M4 Extruder

## **Assembly**
### 1) press the collet into the top of the printed mid body *note the angle of the bore - try to push the collet is inline with the bore in the mid body.*
