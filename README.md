## Bowden Mini After Burner

This allows you to convert your V0.1 Mini Afterburner to a Bowden system with a single printed part. The only Additional hardware you need is an embedded collet as used in the M4 Extruder

**Assembly**
1) press the collet into the top of the printed mid body *note the angle of the bore and try to push the collet in so that the axis of each are parallel.


2) push the teflon tube in to the desired length. It should stick out the bottom by some amount which is determined by whichever hotend you use (see v0.1 manual) 



3) Assemble mini afterburner as usual
