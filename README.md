# Bowden Mini After Burner

This is the same extruder that I used to hit 200k, 500k adn even 1000k acceleration (That's not typo, that's *literally* 1000 times higher than a Prusa Mk3)      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTcdD8uvqYk&ab

This mod allows you to convert your V0.1 Mini Afterburner to a Bowden system with a single printed part. The only additional hardware you need is an ECAS04 embedded collet as used in the M4 Extruder

## **Assembly**
### 1) press the collet into the top of the printed mid body *note the angle of the bore - try to push the collet is inline with the bore in the mid body.*

### 2) push the teflon tube in to the desired length. It should stick out the bottom by some amount which is determined by whichever hotend you use (see v0.1 manual )

### 3) Assemble mini afterburner as usual except omit the original mid body and idler lever.


## NOTES
* Design is currently in pre-alpha 
* two STLs are available. One with typical voron tolerances and a second one with looser tolerances for printers that tend to overextrude a little
