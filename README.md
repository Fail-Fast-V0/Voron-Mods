# Bowden Mini After Burner

This is the same extruder that I used to hit 200k, 500k and even 1000k acceleration (That's not typo, that's *literally* 1000 times higher than a Prusa Mk3)      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTcdD8uvqYk&ab

This mod allows you to convert your V0.1 Mini Afterburner to a Bowden system with a single printed part. The only additional hardware you need is an ECAS04 embedded collet as used in the M4 Extruder

## **Assembly**
### 1) press the collet into the top of the printed mid body *note the angle of the bore - try to push the collet so that it is inline with the bore in the mid body.*

### 2) push the teflon tube in to the desired length. It should stick out the bottom by some amount which is determined by whichever hotend you use (see v0.1 manual )

### 3) Assemble mini afterburner as usual except omit the original mid body and idler lever.


## NOTES
* Design is currently in pre-alpha 
* two STLs are available. One with typical voron tolerances and a second one with looser tolerances for printers that tend to overextrude a little

# Voron V0.1 Wide Feet
Idk about you but my machine will walk right off my table when I'm running speed benchys, so I designed these feet.They are taller and wider than the normal V0.1 feet. They measure 50mm top to bottom and have 6mm holes in the corners to allow you to bolt your printer to a table, concrete slab, moving train or whatever your heart desires.
